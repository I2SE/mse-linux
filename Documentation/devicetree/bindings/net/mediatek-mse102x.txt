* Mediatek MSE102x (SPI)

The Mediatek MSE102x is a family of Homeplug GreenPHY chips. They can be
connected either via RGMII, RMII or SPI to a host CPU.

In order to use the MSE102x as SPI device it must be defined as a child of a
SPI master in the device tree.

Required properties:
- compatible	    : Should be "mediatek,mse1021" or "mediatek,mse1022"
- reg		    : Should specify the SPI chip select
- interrupts	    : The first cell should specify the index of the source
		      interrupt and the second cell should specify the trigger
		      type as rising edge
- spi-cpha	    : Must be set
- spi-cpol	    : Must be set

Optional properties:
- spi-max-frequency : Maximum frequency of the SPI bus the chip can operate at.
		      Numbers smaller than 1000000 or greater than 7000000
		      are invalid. Missing the property will set the SPI
		      frequency to 6000000 Hertz.

The MAC address will be determined using the optional properties
defined in ethernet.txt.

Example:

@spi0 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	mse1021: ethernet@0 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mse1021";
		reg = <0>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
		interrupts = <23 0x1>;		/* rising edge */
		spi-cpha;			/* SPI mode: CPHA=1 */
		spi-cpol;			/* SPI mode: CPOL=1 */
		spi-max-frequency = <7000000>;
		local-mac-address = [ A0 B0 C0 D0 E0 F0 ];
	};
};
