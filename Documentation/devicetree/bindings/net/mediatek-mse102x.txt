* Mediatek MSE102x (SPI)

Mediatek's MSE102x are a family is HomePlug GreenPHY chips.
They can be connected either via RGMII, RMII or SPI to a host CPU.

In order to use a MSE102x chip as SPI device, it must be defined as
a child of an SPI master device in the device tree.

Required properties:
- compatible	    : Should be "mediatek,mse1021" or "mediatek,mse1022"
- reg		    : Should specify the SPI chip select
- interrupts	    : The first cell should specify the index of the source
		      interrupt and the second cell should specify the trigger
		      type as rising edge
- spi-cpha	    : Must be set
- spi-cpol	    : Must be set

Optional properties:
- spi-max-frequency : Maximum frequency of the SPI bus when accessing the chip.
		      Must be in the range 1000000 to 7142857 (in Hertz).
		      If this property is missing, the driver will use the
		      above mentioned maximum value. To achieve the maximum
		      GreenPHY data rate, the SPI clock should not be lower
		      than 6000000 Hz.
- local-mac-address : See ethernet.txt in the same directory.

Example:

@spi0 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;

	mse1021: ethernet@0 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mse1021";
		reg = <0>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
		interrupts = <23 0x1>;		/* rising edge */
		spi-cpha;			/* SPI mode: CPHA=1 */
		spi-cpol;			/* SPI mode: CPOL=1 */
		spi-max-frequency = <7142857>;
		local-mac-address = [ A0 B0 C0 D0 E0 F0 ];
	};
};
